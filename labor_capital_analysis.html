<h1>The Labor-Capital Power Shift</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Eight charts that reveal how economic rewards have shifted from workers to capital owners, machines, and foreign competitors</p>
<p style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 0.5rem; text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;">Last updated: July 6, 2025 @ 15:42 UTC - Now includes China Shock analysis</p>

<div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Long-Term Shift from Labor to Capital in U.S. Income Distribution</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The following analysis examines peer-reviewed economic literature on the structural forces behind labor's declining share of national income.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">In 1950, U.S. labor compensation made up roughly 50% of national income. By 2024, it has fallen to just 42.5% – the lowest since the Great Depression. This shift represents a massive transfer of economic rewards from workers to capital owners, driven by multiple interrelated forces that economists have extensively documented.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 1: Labor Share -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>1. Labor's Shrinking Slice of the Economic Pie</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Labor compensation as a percentage of national income has steadily declined, especially since 2000</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="laborShareChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Historical Context</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Economists have long noted this decline in labor's share, but only recently understood its full implications. After remaining roughly stable for decades – one of Kaldor's "stylized facts" – labor's share began its downward trend in the 1980s. Leading economists like Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have documented how this shift coincides with surging inequality and wealth concentration.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The data speaks volumes: a drop from 50% to 42.5% represents hundreds of billions of dollars annually that once went to workers' paychecks now flowing to corporate profits and capital returns. This isn't just an abstract economic statistic – it's the reason why many American families feel they're working harder but falling behind.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 2: Productivity vs Compensation -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>2. The Productivity-Pay Disconnect</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Worker productivity has soared while compensation has barely budged, creating a massive gap</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="productivityChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #dc2626;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">Breaking the Social Contract</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">For most of American history, productivity and pay rose in tandem – a social contract ensuring that as workers became more productive, they shared in the gains. But starting in the 1970s, this link was severed. The 388% productivity growth versus 212% compensation growth represents one of the most dramatic economic shifts of the modern era.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) attribute much of this to the declining price of capital goods – as computers and machinery became cheaper, firms substituted technology for workers. Bergholt, Furlanetto, and Maffei-Faccioli (2022) in the American Economic Journal concluded that automation is the single biggest driver of this divergence.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The gap between these lines isn't just statistical noise – it represents trillions of dollars that workers produced but never received, instead flowing to shareholders and executives.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 3: Corporate Profits -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>3. Corporate Profits at Historic Highs</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">As labor's share declined, corporate profits as a percentage of GDP reached record levels</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="profitsChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #dc2626;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Financialization of America</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The surge in corporate profits from ~7% of GDP in the early 1990s to over 13% today represents what economists call "financialization" – the increasing dominance of financial motives in the economy. The International Labour Organization (2013) found that financialization was the single largest factor in falling wage shares worldwide, accounting for 46% of the decline.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">William Lazonick's research revealed the mechanism: from 2003-2012, S&P 500 companies used 91% of their earnings on stock buybacks and dividends, leaving little for wage increases or productive investment. This "downsize-and-distribute" model replaced the post-war "retain-and-reinvest" approach.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Notice how profit spikes often coincide with recessions – when workers lose bargaining power, corporate profits tend to surge.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 4: Union Membership -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>4. The Collapse of Worker Bargaining Power</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Private sector union membership has plummeted, tracking closely with labor's declining share</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="unionChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #10b981;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Death of Collective Bargaining</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The parallel decline of unions and labor share is no coincidence. <a href="https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf" target="_blank">Western and Rosenfeld (2011)</a> found that union decline explains 20-33% of rising wage inequality among men. As unions weakened from one-third of workers in the 1950s to just 10% today, workers lost their primary tool for claiming a fair share of economic growth.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The visual correlation is striking: as union membership fell from 20% to 10% since 1983, labor's share of GDP fell in near-perfect tandem. Unions didn't just raise wages for members – they set standards that lifted all workers. Their collapse left individual workers powerless against increasingly concentrated corporate power.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A recent Federal Reserve study found that workers' bargaining power declined 10-15% since 1980, directly contributing to wage stagnation.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 5: Corporate Tax Rates -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>5. The Corporate Tax Giveaway</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">While statutory rates fell from 52% to 21%, effective rates (what corporations actually pay) dropped even more dramatically</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="taxChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Real Tax Giveaway: Effective Rates Tell the True Story</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">While the statutory rate cut from 52% to 21% was dramatic, the effective rate story is even more striking. In the 1950s, corporations actually paid about 40% of their profits in taxes. By 2024, despite a 21% statutory rate, corporations pay just 11.9% – benefiting from loopholes, deductions, and creative accounting.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The decline is staggering: effective corporate tax rates fell from 39.6% in the 1950s to just 8.9% in the 2020s. This means corporations today keep over 90% of their profits, compared to just 60% in the post-war era. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31111" target="_blank">Kaymak and Schott (2023)</a> found that this tax decline can explain about half of the labor share decline in manufacturing.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Most shocking: even during the 2017 tax cut, the effective rate was already at historic lows (11.7% in 2010). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act pushed an already minimal tax burden even lower. In 2020, corporations paid just 8.9% – the lowest effective rate in modern history.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This represents hundreds of billions annually that once funded schools, infrastructure, and social programs now flowing directly to shareholders. It wasn't inevitable – it was a choice.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 6: Corporate Tax vs Labor Share -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>6. The Twin Decline: How Corporate Tax Cuts Track Labor's Falling Share</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">As corporate tax rates fell from 50% to 21%, labor's share of income declined in near-perfect correlation</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="taxLaborShareChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #7c3aed;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">A Perfect Correlation of Power</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The parallel decline of corporate tax rates and labor's share of income is no coincidence. As tax rates fell from around 50% in the 1950s to just 21% today, labor's share dropped from 65% to 57%. This represents one of the clearest policy-outcome relationships in modern economics.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Each major tax cut coincided with a further erosion of worker power: Reagan's 1986 cuts, Bush's 2001 cuts, and Trump's 2017 cuts all accelerated the transfer of income from workers to capital. The mechanism is straightforward: lower taxes increase after-tax returns to capital, incentivizing automation and offshoring while reducing the tax revenue needed for public investments that support workers.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This isn't just correlation – it's causation. When we stopped taxing capital, we stopped valuing labor.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 7: The Missing Middle -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>7. The Missing Middle: How America's Income Distribution Hollowed Out</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">The middle class shrank from 61% to 51% as Americans moved to both extremes – but mostly upward</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="middleClassChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #8b5cf6;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Barbell Economy: Winners and Losers</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">America's economy has split into two tracks. On one side: capital-intensive firms like Google, Goldman Sachs, and biotech companies that hire fewer, highly-paid workers. On the other: labor-intensive service businesses – restaurants, retail, care work – offering low wages and few benefits.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The casualties? Middle-income jobs that once sustained the American Dream. When Sears employed 300,000 workers in the 1980s, most earned middle-class wages with benefits. Today's retail giant Amazon employs 1.5 million, but most are warehouse workers earning half what Sears employees made (adjusted for inflation). Travel agents, bank tellers, manufacturing workers – entire occupations that provided pathways to the middle class have vanished.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">As MIT economist David Autor documented, automation eliminates "routine" middle-skill jobs while complementing high-skill work and leaving low-skill service jobs untouched. The result: job polarization that mirrors income polarization.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The numbers don't lie: while 8% moved up to high incomes, only 3% fell to low incomes. But this masks the real tragedy – those who lost middle-class jobs rarely moved up. Instead, new college graduates claimed the high-income spots while displaced workers competed for service jobs. Same economy, different worlds.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 8: Income Share Distribution -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>8. The Real Wealth Transfer: Share of Total Income by Class</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Upper-income households captured nearly all income gains, now holding 48% of total income despite being only 19% of adults</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="incomeShareChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #fee2e2; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid #dc2626;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #991b1b;">The Concentration of Wealth: Where the Money Really Went</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">While the middle class shrank by 10 percentage points in population, their share of total income collapsed by 19 points – from 62% to 43%. Meanwhile, the upper-income tier nearly doubled their share from 29% to 48%, despite growing from just 11% to 19% of the population.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">This reveals the true nature of inequality: it's not just about how many people are in each tier, but how much of the economic pie they control. Today, the richest 19% of Americans control nearly half of all income – more than the entire middle class.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Most striking: lower-income Americans, despite growing from 27% to 30% of the population, saw their already meager share of income shrink further from 10% to just 9%. The American economy hasn't just polarized – it has fundamentally redistributed rewards upward.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 9: Geographic Income Polarization -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>9. The Geography of Inequality: Middle Class Thresholds by State</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Income needed to be middle class varies dramatically by state – from $36k in Mississippi to $200k in DC</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="geographicChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f3f4f6; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #6366f1;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">America's Economic Geography: Two Different Countries</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The hollowing out of the middle class isn't happening uniformly – it's creating two Americas. In tech hubs and financial centers, the middle class threshold has soared: you need $150k+ to be middle class in San Francisco, New York, or DC. Meanwhile, in the Rust Belt and rural South, $50k still qualifies as middle income.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">This geographic divergence reinforces the barbell economy. High-cost metros concentrate capital-intensive industries (tech, finance, biotech) that pay fewer people more. Low-cost regions house the service economy – retail, hospitality, care work – where wages remain stagnant.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The data reveals stark patterns: coastal metros have both the highest share of upper-income households (25-30%) and the lowest share of middle class (40-45%). Interior cities maintain larger middle classes (55-65%) but with much lower absolute incomes. The American Dream now depends on your ZIP code.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Most concerning: this geographic sorting is accelerating. As remote work enables high earners to colonize lower-cost areas, they drive up prices without creating middle-class jobs, further hollowing out local economies.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 10: Industrial Robots Impact -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>10. The Automation Wave: Robots Replacing Workers</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Each robot per 1,000 workers reduces employment by 0.2% and wages by 0.42% (Acemoglu-Restrepo)</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="robotsChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #8b5cf6;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Acceleration of Job Displacement</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The quadrupling of robot density from 1993 to 2015 represents a new phase in the labor-capital struggle. <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705716" target="_blank">Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)</a> found that each additional robot per 1,000 workers reduces employment by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42% – with each robot replacing 3-6 human workers.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">These are what <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24196" target="_blank">Acemoglu calls "so-so technologies"</a> – just good enough to replace workers but not transformative enough to create new opportunities. Unlike past technological revolutions that eventually created new jobs, modern automation often simply eliminates work.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The impact compounds: regions with more robots saw larger declines in employment and wages, creating "robot zones" of economic distress. And this is just the beginning – artificial intelligence threatens to automate cognitive work next.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The 0.61% cumulative wage decline may seem modest, but it represents billions in annual income transferred from workers to the owners of capital – the machines themselves.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 11: China Shock -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>11. The China Shock: When Global Trade Devastated U.S. Manufacturing</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Chinese import penetration surged 12-fold, destroying millions of manufacturing jobs in America's heartland</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="chinaShockChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div style="background: #f9fafb; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: #1e293b;">The Most Dramatic Trade Shock in History</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The "China shock" identified by economists Autor, Dorn, and Hanson represents the most sudden and devastating trade impact ever experienced by American workers. Chinese imports as a share of U.S. spending exploded from 0.6% in 1990 to 7.2% by 2020 – a twelve-fold increase that was particularly dramatic after China's WTO entry in 2001.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The human cost was staggering: 2.4 million manufacturing jobs lost between 1990 and 2007, accounting for 25% of all U.S. manufacturing job losses in that period. Unlike previous trade shocks, these jobs never came back. Workers in affected regions experienced permanent income losses, with wages falling 0.5-0.8 percentage points (central estimate: 0.6pp) in manufacturing employment share for every $1,000 increase in import exposure per worker.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The scatter plot below shows the devastating correlation: regions with higher Chinese import exposure (horizontal axis) experienced dramatically larger manufacturing job losses (vertical axis). Each dot represents an American community whose economic foundation was swept away by the tide of globalization.</p>

<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>12. The Geography of Devastation: How Import Competition Destroyed Local Economies</h2>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">North Hickory sat at the bull's-eye of the China boom: $6,030 of new imports per worker and a five-point collapse in factory employment. New York City, barely touched by Chinese manufacturing competition, lost essentially no factory share and kept adding high-paying service jobs. The same national trade policy produced opposite local destinies.</p>

Autor and colleagues found no evidence of recovery in manufacturing employment or workers' lifetime earnings even a decade later.<sup>*</sup> Unlike the economic theory that promised new jobs would replace old ones, these communities experienced persistent unemployment, rising disability claims (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w19507" target="_blank">Autor et al., 2014</a>), and declining marriage rates (<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181101" target="_blank">Autor et al., 2018</a>).</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The political consequences were profound: regions hit hardest by Chinese import competition shifted dramatically toward political extremes, expressing their economic despair through the ballot box (<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/685631" target="_blank">Feigenbaum & Hall, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/importing-political-polarization/" target="_blank">Autor et al., 2020</a>). The bipartisan consensus on free trade, built over decades, shattered in these hollowed-out factory towns.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">This wasn't creative destruction – it was just destruction. The China shock proves that when global capitalism moves too fast, it doesn't create opportunity; it creates wastelands.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic;">*Note: A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/on-the-persistence-of-the-china-shock/" target="_blank">2021 follow-up by Autor et al.</a> found that while local GDP eventually rebounds through growth in health care, education, and retail sectors, manufacturing jobs and the lifetime earnings of displaced workers never recover.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">These twelve charts tell a unified story: over the past 50 years, America has witnessed one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history – not between individuals, but between economic classes. The transfer from labor to capital, accelerated by automation and globalization.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  
  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Leading economists have reached a consensus: this wasn't accidental or inevitable. It was the result of deliberate policy choices, technological changes that favored capital, and the systematic dismantling of worker protections.</p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: 600;">The question for America's future: Will we continue down this path, or will we build an economy that once again rewards work, not just wealth?</p>

  <h3>Key Takeaways: The Systematic Shift from Labor to Capital</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Labor's Declining Share:</strong> From ~50% of national income in the 1960s to just 42% today – the lowest since the Great Depression</li>
    <li><strong>The Productivity-Pay Gap:</strong> Worker productivity soared 388% since 1948, but real compensation grew only 212% – breaking the historic link between output and wages</li>
    <li><strong>Record Corporate Profits:</strong> Now claiming ~13% of GDP, nearly double the ~7% levels of the early 1990s</li>
    <li><strong>Collapsed Worker Power:</strong> Private sector unionization plummeted from 20% to 10%, tracking perfectly with labor's declining share</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Policy Favoring Capital:</strong> Effective corporate tax rates plummeted from 40% to 12% – corporations now keep 88% of profits vs 60% in the 1950s</li>
    <li><strong>The Automation Wave:</strong> Industrial robots quadrupled (1993-2015), directly replacing workers and reducing wages</li>
    <li><strong>The China Shock:</strong> Import penetration surged 12-fold, destroying 2.4 million manufacturing jobs with no recovery</li>
    <li><strong>Cumulative Impact:</strong> These interconnected forces represent a systematic reallocation of economic rewards from those who work to those who own</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Academic Consensus</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Leading economists attribute labor's declining share to multiple reinforcing factors:</p>
  <ul style="font-size: 0.95rem;">
    <li><strong>Technology/Automation:</strong> ~40-50% of the decline (<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/669061" target="_blank">Karabarbounis & Neiman 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705716" target="_blank">Acemoglu & Restrepo 2020</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Financialization:</strong> ~20-30% (<a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/global-wage-report/2013/WCMS_194843/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">ILO 2013</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cje/article/37/4/921/1712099" target="_blank">Stockhammer 2013</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> ~15-25% (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w16907" target="_blank">Elsby et al. 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121" target="_blank">Autor et al. 2013</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Declining Union Power:</strong> ~20-25% (<a href="https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf" target="_blank">Western & Rosenfeld 2011</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Policy:</strong> Enabling factor (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31111" target="_blank">Kaymak & Schott 2023</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">These estimates underscore that no single cause is responsible – it was a confluence of economic forces and deliberate policy choices that shifted rewards from labor to capital.</p>
