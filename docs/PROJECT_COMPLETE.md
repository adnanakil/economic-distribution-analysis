## Key Empirical Evidence Cited

### Major Studies
- **Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020):** Robots and Jobs - each robot replaces 3.3 workers in US
- **Dauth et al. (2021):** German labor markets - each robot displaced 2 workers but created 2.4 service jobs
- **Graetz & Michaels (2018):** Cross-country evidence - robots contributed 10% of GDP growth
- **Autor, Levy & Murnane (2003):** Task-based framework for automation effects
- **Brynjolfsson et al. (2023):** AI increased customer service productivity 14%, with 34% gains for novices

### Key Statistics
- US robot density: 285 per 10,000 workers (vs Germany 415, South Korea 1,012)
- US private sector union density: 6.1% (down from 24.2% in 1973)
- Routine occupations: Declined from 56% to 46% of employment (1980-2016)
- College wage premium: 84% (up from 48% in 1979)
- Danish ALMP spending: 2.1% of GDP (vs US 0.4%)

### Case Studies
1. **ATMs and bank tellers** - automation increased employment initially
2. **Amazon warehouses** - 25x employment growth alongside robotics
3. **German vs US automotive** - same technology, different institutional outcomes
4. **South Korean shipbuilding** - rapid automation with rising wages
5. **Finnish UBI** - improved wellbeing, no employment effects
