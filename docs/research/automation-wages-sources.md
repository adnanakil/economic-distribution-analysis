## Core Empirical Papers

### Acemoglu & Restrepo - Robots and Jobs (2020)
**Citation:** Acemoglu, D., & Restrepo, P. (2020). "Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets." Journal of Political Economy, 128(6), 2188-2244.

**Key Findings:**
- One additional robot per thousand workers reduces employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points
- Each robot replaces approximately 3.3 workers on average
- Wage effects: one robot per thousand workers lowers wages by 0.42%
- Effects concentrated in manufacturing-heavy commuting zones
- Displacement effects particularly strong for routine manual workers
- Limited evidence of offsetting job creation in other sectors

**Important Statistics:**
- Robot stock in US increased from 0.5 to 1.75 per thousand workers (1993-2014)
- Manufacturing employment fell 17% in high-exposure areas vs 6% in low-exposure areas
- No significant wage gains for non-exposed workers, suggesting limited productivity spillovers

**Notable Quotes:**
- "We find large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages"
- "The effects are driven by manufacturing industries and are especially strong in industries most exposed to robots"

**Supports Thesis:** Provides core empirical evidence for displacement effects while showing variation by geography and occupation

### Acemoglu & Restrepo - The Wrong Kind of AI (2019)
**Citation:** Acemoglu, D., & Restrepo, P. (2019). "Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33(2), 3-30.

**Key Findings:**
- Distinguishes between "so-so automation" (pure displacement) and productivity-enhancing automation
- US automation has been particularly displacement-focused compared to task-creating innovation
- Lack of new task creation explains stagnant median wages since 1980s
- Labor share of income declined from 66% (1980) to 58% (2017) in US

**Important Statistics:**
- Routine occupations declined from 56% to 46% of employment (1980-2016)
- Non-routine cognitive occupations increased from 30% to 39%
- But many new jobs are low-wage service positions, not high-productivity tasks

**Notable Quotes:**
- "Much recent automation has been 'so-so' - good enough to replace labor but not so good as to dramatically increase productivity"
- "The US economy has been going through a transition in which the creation of new tasks has slowed down"

**Supports Thesis:** Explains why aggregate productivity gains haven't translated to broad wage growth - the type of automation matters

- Robots contributed 10% of GDP per capita growth in these countries
- No significant negative effect on total hours worked at country level
- Effects vary by skill level: low-skill workers see wage declines, high-skill workers see gains
- Countries with higher initial robot density saw larger productivity gains

**Important Statistics:**
- Robot stock increased by 150% across sample countries (1993-2007)
- Productivity contribution ranges from 0.19% (Spain) to 0.50% (Germany) annually
- High-skill workers' wages increased 3.2% relative to low-skill workers

**Notable Quotes:**
- "Our results suggest that robots increase productivity, but the benefits are not equally distributed"
- "The divergence in outcomes between skill groups suggests that policy interventions may be needed"

**Supports Thesis:** Shows cross-country variation and demonstrates that institutional context shapes distributional outcomes

**Key Findings:**
- Germany added robots faster than any other economy (1994-2014) but maintained stable manufacturing employment
- Each robot displaced 2 manufacturing workers BUT created 2.4 jobs in services
- Workers pushed out of manufacturing moved to other sectors with only modest wage losses (2-3%)
- Strong apprenticeship system and works councils facilitated adjustment
- Regional variation matters: manufacturing regions saw larger worker flows but better wage outcomes

**Important Statistics:**
- Robot density in Germany rose from 1 to 3.5 per thousand workers (1994-2014)
- Manufacturing employment stable at ~7.5 million despite automation
- Service sector gained 3.5 million jobs in same period
- Wage losses for displaced workers: 2-3% on average (vs 8-10% in US studies)

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Amazon Warehouses - Automation Without Displacement
**Background:**
- Amazon deployed 750,000+ robots in warehouses by 2023
- Kiva/Amazon Robotics systems move shelves to workers
- Widely predicted to eliminate warehouse jobs

**Actual Outcomes:**
- US warehouse employment increased from 950,000 (2014) to 1,830,000 (2023)
- Amazon's US workforce grew from 154,000 (2014) to 1,540,000 (2023)
- But: wages stagnated, working conditions intensified
- Automation enabled business model expansion, creating jobs
- Changed nature of work: from picking/packing to monitoring/supervision

**Key Insight:**
- Automation increased labor demand by enabling business growth
- But work became more intense and monitoring increased
- Shows complementarity can coexist with deteriorating job quality

**Sources:**
- Amazon annual reports
- BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
- Kantor et al. "The Amazon That Customers Don't See" (NYT, 2021)

### Case Study 2: ATMs and Bank Tellers - The Complement Story
**Background:**
- ATMs introduced in 1970s-80s, predicted to eliminate bank tellers
- By 2000, ATMs handled most routine cash transactions

**Actual Outcomes:**
- Bank teller employment in US: 485,000 (1980) → 600,000 (2010) → 472,000 (2023)
- Initially rose because ATMs reduced cost per branch, enabling branch expansion
- Teller role shifted from transaction processing to relationship banking
- Recent decline due to mobile banking, not ATMs

**Key Statistics:**
- Number of US bank branches: 38,000 (1980) → 94,000 (2010) → 78,000 (2023)
- ATMs per teller: 0.1 (1980) → 0.8 (2010) → 1.2 (2023)
- Teller wages remained relatively flat (adjusted for inflation)

**Key Insight:**
- Short-term complementarity (ATMs enabled expansion)
- Long-term task transformation (from transactions to relationships)
- Eventually displacement from subsequent automation (mobile banking)

**Key Differences:**
- German works councils gave workers voice in how automation implemented
- Apprenticeship system provided continuous skill upgrading
- IG Metall (union) negotiated training guarantees and no forced redundancies
- US system more adversarial, leading to two-tier wages and outsourcing

**Key Insight:**
