# Research Gaps: Automation and Wages

## Critical Questions Needing Further Research

### 1. Long-term AI Effects Still Unknown
**What We Don't Know:**
- Will AI's skill-compressing effects (helping bottom performers) persist as technology matures?
- What happens when AI moves beyond "suitable tasks" frontier?
- Dell'Acqua study shows 40% productivity gain on suitable tasks but 19% worse on unsuitable - how do firms and workers navigate this "jagged frontier"?
- Is current evidence of complementarity temporary (like ATMs initially increasing teller employment)?

**Missing Evidence:**
- Long-term panel studies of AI adoption (current studies are 2-3 years max)
- Broader industry coverage beyond customer service and consulting
- Effects on medium and high-skill workers in knowledge work
- Wage effects of AI (most studies focus on productivity/employment)

**Research Priority:** HIGH - Generative AI represents potential shift in automation's distributional effects

### 2. Causality vs Correlation in Institutional Effects
**What We Don't Know:**
- Do strong institutions enable better automation outcomes, or do countries with good outcomes select into strong institutions?
- Germany's success: Is it works councils, apprenticeships, high union density, or broader cultural factors?
- Can institutional arrangements be transplanted or are they path-dependent?
- Why did Nordic model work in small, homogeneous countries - would it scale?

**Missing Evidence:**
- Natural experiments or policy discontinuities that isolate institutional effects
- Attempts to implement German/Nordic policies in different contexts
- Within-country variation in institutional strength and automation outcomes
- Historical counterfactuals (what if US had maintained 1960s union density?)

**Research Priority:** HIGH - Critical for policy prescription confidence

### 3. Measurement Problems in Automation Impact
**What We Don't Know:**
- Are we measuring the right things? (Jobs vs tasks vs earnings vs welfare)
- Quality of new jobs created (Amazon created jobs but are they "good jobs"?)
- Indirect effects on communities, families, social cohesion
- Regional multiplier effects beyond commuting zones
- Non-pecuniary job aspects (autonomy, dignity, stress, control)

**Missing Evidence:**
- Comprehensive job quality measures beyond wages
- Community-level impact studies (schools, crime, health, civic participation)
- Intergenerational effects (children of displaced workers)
- Spillover effects on non-automated sectors and occupations
- Mental health and wellbeing outcomes

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Affects how we evaluate "success"

### 4. Political Economy of Automation Policy
**What We Don't Know:**
- Why do some countries adopt worker-protective policies while others don't?
- What political coalitions support institutional strengthening?
- How do automation winners and losers translate into political power?
- Can policy change happen before or only after displacement crisis?
- Role of employer preferences (when do firms support vs oppose worker protection?)

**Missing Evidence:**
- Political economy case studies of policy adoption
- Analysis of failed policy attempts (what blocked Nordic model adoption elsewhere?)
- Business lobbying and automation policy formation
- Voter preferences on automation and redistribution
- Role of techno-optimist ideology in policy resistance

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - Important for understanding feasibility of policy recommendations

### 5. Small Business and Automation
**What We Don't Know:**
- Most research focuses on large firms - what about SMEs?
- Do small businesses face different automation trade-offs?
- Can small firms offer better adjustment because of flexibility?
- Or are workers more vulnerable without HR infrastructure?
- Regional concentration in SME-heavy areas

**Missing Evidence:**
- Firm-size variation in automation adoption and worker outcomes
- Small business case studies
- SME-specific institutional support systems
- Differential effects of works councils (only large firms in Germany)
- Franchises and platform-mediated small businesses

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - May reveal hidden heterogeneity

### 6. Service Sector Automation Details
**What We Don't Know:**
- Manufacturing automation well-studied, but service sector is 80% of employment
- Which service tasks are actually automatable vs theoretical estimates?
- Customer resistance to automation in face-to-face services
- Quality-productivity trade-offs (automated customer service often worse)
- Healthcare, education, caregiving - can't fully automate but AI assists

**Missing Evidence:**
- Sector-specific automation studies beyond customer service
- Patient/client outcomes under automation
- Professional service automation (law, accounting, medicine)
- Public sector automation (government services)
- Resistance and adoption barriers in services

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - Growing share of economy

### 7. Global South and Developing Countries
**What We Don't Know:**
- All major studies focus on advanced economies
- Will automation eliminate developing country industrialization path?
- How does premature deindustrialization interact with automation?
- Can developing countries leapfrog to automated manufacturing?
- Effects on global value chains and trade

**Missing Evidence:**
- Studies from China, India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa
- Automation in labor-intensive manufacturing (garments, footwear)
- Effect on FDI location decisions
- Institutional capacity for adjustment in resource-constrained countries
- Role of informal sector

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - Huge welfare implications but data scarce

---

### 8. Specific Policy Mechanism Effectiveness
**What We Need More Data On:**
- **UBI:** Finnish study showed no employment effect - but was it too small ($560/month), too short (2 years), or wrong target (unemployed)? Need larger, longer experiments with different populations
- **Lifelong learning:** Singapore shows 70% participation but only 8% wage gains for switchers. Is this worth the cost? What's the counterfactual?
- **Wage insurance:** Denmark successful but requires 2.8% GDP spending and high trust. What's minimum viable version?
- **Works councils:** German success, but US legal framework prohibits. What are feasible alternatives? What about sectoral bargaining?

**Missing Evidence:**
- RCTs or natural experiments for each policy type
- Cost-benefit analyses with long time horizons
- Interaction effects between policies (do they complement or substitute?)
- Minimum effective doses (what's smallest intervention that works?)
- Political feasibility constraints

**Research Priority:** HIGH - Directly actionable for policy

### 9. Timing and Transition Dynamics
**What We Don't Know:**
- How fast is automation actually happening? (Projections vary wildly)
- Do gradual transitions allow better adjustment than rapid shocks?
- Optimal warning time for workers and communities
- When to intervene - ex ante (before displacement) or ex post (after)?
- Speed limits on automation adoption (beyond natural diffusion)

**Missing Evidence:**
- Time-series analysis of adoption curves across technologies
- Worker adjustment success by displacement timeline
- Early intervention programs vs remedial programs
- Advance notice requirements and outcomes
- Deliberate slowdown policies (regulations, taxes) and effects

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects urgency and policy design

- Political radicalization and automation (economic anxiety â†’ extremism?)
- Health outcomes beyond immediate stress

**Missing Evidence:**
- Qualitative studies of worker experiences
- Longitudinal health data in automation-affected regions
- Social capital and civic participation measures
- Political behavior and voting patterns
- Cultural shifts in work attitudes

**Research Priority:** MEDIUM - Important for comprehensive policy evaluation

### 2. Real-Time Labor Market Tracking
- Job posting data (Burning Glass, Lightcast) promising but imperfect
- Need better tracking of skill demand evolution
- Gig economy and platform work undercounted in traditional surveys
- More frequent, more granular employment statistics

### 3. Technology Adoption Microdata
- When exactly do firms adopt robots/AI?
- What drives adoption decisions?
- Internal vs external pressures
- Current data often years delayed and highly aggregated

### 4. International Comparable Data
- Cross-country studies hampered by different definitions, measurements
- Need standardized surveys on automation exposure
- Harmonized institutional data
- Comparable policy intervention data
