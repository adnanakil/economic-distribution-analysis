## III. The Complementarity Divide: Why Some Workers Benefit

### 3.1 When Machines Enhance Human Value

Not all automation reduces demand for labor. In specific circumstances, technological change can increase both employment and wages by making human workers more productive. The key lies in complementarity—when machines enhance rather than replace human capabilities.

The most striking evidence comes from the automated teller machine (ATM). Between 1995 and 2010, the number of ATMs in the United States increased from roughly 100,000 to 400,000. Conventional wisdom predicted mass layoffs of bank tellers. Instead, the number of tellers employed actually increased during this period.[^1]

The mechanism was counterintuitive but economically rational. ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch by approximately 30%. This made it profitable to open more branches in more locations. While each branch employed fewer tellers (averaging 13 instead of 20), the total number of branches increased faster than the reduction in tellers per branch. The result was net job creation in a role that appeared ripe for automation.[^2]

But the ATM story reveals something more fundamental: the nature of the teller job itself changed. Freed from routine cash-handling tasks, tellers shifted toward relationship banking—helping customers with loans, investment products, and financial advice. This transformation increased the skill requirements of the position but also increased the value each teller provided. The machine didn't replace the human; it redirected human effort toward higher-value activities that machines couldn't perform.

This pattern of task reallocation appears repeatedly when automation complements rather than substitutes for human labor. In manufacturing, the introduction of computer numerical control (CNC) machines in the 1980s and 1990s didn't eliminate machinists—it changed their role from manual operation to programming and oversight. Machinists who could program CNC machines saw wage premiums of 15-20% compared to their predecessors.[^3]

### 3.2 The Amazon Paradox: More Robots, More Workers

Amazon's warehouse automation offers perhaps the most extensively documented case of complementary technological change. After acquiring Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics) in 2012, the company deployed over 520,000 robotic drive units in its fulfillment centers by 2021.[^4]

The productivity gains were substantial. Warehouses with Kiva robots could hold 50% more inventory in the same space and fulfill orders 2-3 times faster. Operating costs per unit fell by approximately 20%.[^5] Every economic model based on labor-capital substitution predicted massive job losses.

Instead, Amazon's warehouse workforce in the United States grew from 20,000 in 2012 to over 500,000 in 2021—a 25-fold increase.[^6] The robots didn't replace workers; they made Amazon's business model viable at a scale that created unprecedented demand for human labor.

The mechanism involved several reinforcing effects. Lower operating costs enabled Amazon to offer faster delivery at lower prices, expanding market share dramatically. Each new fulfillment center, despite heavy automation, required hundreds of human workers for tasks robots couldn't perform: receiving shipments, problem-solving, quality control, and handling non-standard items. The robots specialized in the repetitive task of moving standardized shelving units, while humans specialized in judgment, flexibility, and fine motor skills.

Critically, this complementarity was task-specific, not job-specific. The same worker might see some tasks automated (walking to retrieve items) while other tasks became more important (operating scanning systems, managing exceptions, training new employees). The overall effect on employment was positive, but the nature of warehouse work changed substantially.

However, the Amazon case also illuminates the limitations of complementarity. While total employment increased, wages for warehouse workers remained relatively stagnant. The median Amazon warehouse worker earned approximately $15-17 per hour in 2021, barely above the wage floor for similar work in 2012.[^7] Automation increased productivity but didn't increase worker bargaining power. The gains from complementarity flowed primarily to consumers (through lower prices) and shareholders (through higher profits) rather than to workers (through higher wages).

### 3.3 Skill-Biased Complementarity: The Returns to Education

The productivity-enhancing effects of automation are not distributed equally across the workforce. They concentrate among workers with skills that complement new technologies—a phenomenon economists call "skill-biased technological change."

The evidence is stark. Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008) found that computerization in the 1980s and 1990s increased demand for college-educated workers by approximately 25% while reducing demand for high school graduates.[^8] Workers who could operate, program, or manage computer systems saw substantial wage gains. Those whose tasks could be codified and automated saw wage stagnation or decline.

This pattern extends beyond the computer revolution. In Germany's automotive sector, the introduction of industrial robots in the 2000s created a bifurcated labor market. Engineers and technicians who could program, maintain, and optimize robotic systems saw wage increases of 8-12%. Assembly line workers whose tasks were automated saw wage growth of only 1-2%, and many faced displacement.[^9]

The South Korean shipbuilding industry provides an even more detailed view of skill-biased complementarity. Between 2000 and 2015, Korean shipyards invested heavily in automated welding, cutting, and assembly systems. A study by Lee and Wie (2015) tracked individual workers through this transition.[^10]

Workers with technical education (engineering degrees or vocational training in automation systems) saw their wages increase by an average of 18% over the period. These workers transitioned into roles operating, programming, and maintaining the new automated systems. Their productivity increased substantially as machines amplified their capabilities.

Workers without technical training faced a different trajectory. Those who could adapt to operating computerized systems saw modest wage gains of 3-5%. Those whose tasks were fully automated either left the industry or moved into lower-wage positions. The average wage for workers without technical skills actually declined by 2% in real terms.[^11]

The complementarity divide thus operates primarily along educational lines. Automation increases the productivity—and therefore the wages—of workers who can leverage it. For workers whose tasks can be fully automated, the technology offers no such benefit.

### 3.4 The Geographic Dimension: Automation Clusters

The benefits of complementary automation also concentrate geographically. Regions with high-skill workforces and strong technical infrastructure capture disproportionate gains.

Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) analyzed local labor markets across 722 commuting zones in the United States. They found that the introduction of industrial robots between 1990 and 2007 had sharply different effects depending on the local skill composition.[^12]

In commuting zones where more than 30% of workers had college degrees, robot adoption was associated with employment growth. These regions saw an average increase of 1.2 jobs for every robot installed, primarily in engineering, maintenance, and technical roles. Wages in these areas increased by an average of 3.7% over the period.

In commuting zones where fewer than 20% of workers had college degrees, the same robot adoption was associated with employment decline. These regions lost an average of 3.3 jobs for every robot installed. Wages in these areas stagnated, growing by only 0.3% over the period.

This geographic polarization created what Autor (2019) calls "manufacturing superstars"—regions where automation complemented high-skilled workers, creating clusters of well-paid employment.[^13] Boston, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area exemplify this pattern, with thriving tech sectors that design, program, and manage automated systems.

Meanwhile, regions historically dependent on routine manufacturing—the Midwest industrial belt, parts of the Southeast—experienced the substitution effects of automation without the compensating complementarity effects. These regions saw both job losses and wage stagnation as automation displaced workers faster than it created new opportunities.

The Amazon effect amplifies this geographic divide. While Amazon warehouses appear throughout the country, the high-wage engineering and technical jobs concentrate in Seattle, where the company designs its robotic systems. The complementarity benefits flow to workers in one location; the substitution effects distribute across many.

This spatial dimension of the complementarity divide has profound implications for policy. Regional differences in skill composition mean that the same technology can be simultaneously beneficial and harmful depending on where it's deployed. National aggregate statistics obscure these divergent local realities.

## IV. The Displacement Trap: Why Many Workers Lose

### 4.1 The Substitution Mechanism

While some automation creates complementarity, much of it operates through direct substitution—machines performing tasks previously done by humans. When substitution dominates, employment and wages decline.

The clearest evidence comes from manufacturing. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) estimated that between 1990 and 2007, each industrial robot in the United States replaced approximately 3.3 workers.[^14] The displacement was concentrated in routine manual tasks: assembly line work, materials handling, quality inspection, and packaging.

The mechanism is straightforward. A robot that welds car frames performs the same task as a human welder, but faster, more consistently, and without requiring breaks, health insurance, or overtime pay. Once the capital cost is amortized, the robot's operating cost is substantially lower than human labor. Firms adopt the technology precisely because it substitutes for workers while reducing costs.

The displacement effects extend beyond the workers directly replaced. When automation reduces labor demand in one sector, displaced workers flood adjacent labor markets, increasing competition for remaining jobs and depressing wages even for workers who weren't directly automated.

Acemoglu and Restrepo tracked this ripple effect across commuting zones. In areas with high robot adoption, wages declined not just for manufacturing workers but also for workers in construction, retail, and services—sectors with no direct automation.[^15] The mechanism was labor market congestion. Displaced manufacturing workers, lacking the skills to transition to high-wage sectors, competed for jobs in local service industries, driving down wages across the board.

### 4.2 Task Polarization and Routine Work

The displacement trap operates most severely on routine tasks—work that follows predictable patterns and can be codified into algorithms. Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) formalized this insight in their "routine-biased technological change" framework.[^16]

Routine manual tasks (assembly line work, data entry, basic bookkeeping) face the highest displacement risk. Machines excel at repetitive physical operations. Routine cognitive tasks (payroll processing, basic accounting, filing) face similar vulnerability. Software can execute rule-based cognitive work with perfect consistency.

The result is task polarization. Employment and wages grow at the top (non-routine cognitive work like management, engineering, and creative services) and the bottom (non-routine manual work like personal care, food service, and building maintenance). The middle hollows out.[^17]

Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms this pattern. Between 1990 and 2020, employment in routine cognitive occupations (administrative support, clerical work) declined by 28%. Employment in routine manual occupations (production, assembly, materials handling) declined by 31%. Meanwhile, employment in non-routine cognitive occupations increased by 52%, and employment in non-routine manual occupations increased by 47%.[^18]

The wage effects mirror this polarization. Workers in routine occupations saw real wage growth of only 2% over thirty years—effectively stagnation. Workers in non-routine cognitive occupations saw wage growth of 35%. Workers in non-routine manual occupations saw minimal growth of 8%, reflecting their weak bargaining position despite increased demand.[^19]

This polarization creates what Autor (2015) calls the "rising floor of skills" necessary for middle-class employment.[^20] As routine tasks automate, the remaining middle-wage jobs require non-routine cognitive skills—precisely the skills least accessible to displaced routine workers.

### 4.3 Transition Barriers and Worker Immobility

Even when new jobs emerge to replace automated ones, workers face substantial barriers to transition. The displacement trap closes most tightly around workers who cannot move—geographically, occupationally, or skill-wise.

The geographic dimension is particularly binding. Manufacturing decline concentrates in specific regions: the Midwest, parts of the Southeast, and Appalachia. New job creation concentrates elsewhere: coastal cities, tech hubs, and university towns. Displaced workers in declining regions cannot easily relocate to growing ones.

The barriers are both economic and social. Moving requires upfront capital for deposits, transportation, and job search. It requires leaving family networks, community ties, and familiar environments. For workers with underwater mortgages in declining housing markets, geographic mobility may be economically impossible.

Notowidigdo (2020) quantified these effects. Displaced manufacturing workers in commuting zones with declining populations were willing to accept wages up to 35% lower than similar workers in growing regions rather than relocate.[^21] This geographic immobility meant that automation's benefits (concentrated in growing regions) and costs (concentrated in declining regions) accrued to entirely different populations.

Occupational mobility faces similar barriers. Transitioning from manufacturing to nursing requires extensive retraining. Transitioning from administrative work to software engineering may be literally impossible for workers without aptitude for programming. The skills demanded by growing sectors often bear no relationship to the skills possessed by displaced workers.

Huckfeldt (2022) studied retraining programs for displaced manufacturing workers in Michigan. Even intensive programs with substantial support achieved occupational transition rates of only 35-40%. The majority of participants either returned to similar manufacturing work (at lower wages) or exited the labor force entirely.[^22]

Age compounds these barriers. Workers displaced in their 50s face particularly dim prospects. Retraining returns diminish with shorter remaining career spans. Age discrimination limits hiring prospects even for retrained workers. Many displaced older workers simply retire early, accepting permanently reduced lifetime earnings.

### 4.4 The Wage-Setting Power Shift

Even workers who retain employment in automated workplaces often experience wage decline through a subtler mechanism: erosion of bargaining power.

Automation changes the elasticity of labor demand—how responsive employment is to wage changes. When workers are essential and difficult to replace, labor demand is inelastic. Firms cannot easily reduce employment in response to wage increases, giving workers bargaining power. When workers are easily replaceable by machines, labor demand becomes elastic. Even small wage increases make automation more attractive, limiting workers' ability to demand higher pay.

Stansbury and Summers (2020) documented this shift empirically. They found that in manufacturing industries with high robot adoption, the relationship between productivity growth and wage growth weakened substantially.[^23] From 1950 to 1980, a 1% increase in productivity was associated with a 0.7% increase in wages. From 1990 to 2020, in industries with high automation, the same 1% productivity increase was associated with only a 0.2% wage increase.

The mechanism operates through credible threats. When firms can credibly threaten to automate in response to wage demands, workers moderate those demands. The threat need not be executed to be effective—the mere possibility disciplines wage negotiations.

Amazon's warehouse wage setting illustrates this dynamic. Despite massive productivity gains from robotics, Amazon maintained starting wages at approximately $15 per hour—just above minimum wage in many locations.[^24] Workers understood that demanding higher wages would accelerate automation of remaining tasks. The robots set an effective wage ceiling.

This effect compounds across the labor market. As automation proceeds in one sector, displaced workers increase labor supply in others, reducing wages through standard supply and demand. Simultaneously, the threat of automation in those sectors limits workers' ability to resist wage cuts. The result is economy-wide wage suppression even in sectors not directly automated.

### 4.5 The Social Cost: Displacement and Community Collapse

The displacement trap extends beyond individual workers to entire communities. When automation concentrates in specific industries and regions, the social fabric deteriorates.

Case and Deaton (2020) documented rising "deaths of despair"—from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related illness—in communities experiencing manufacturing decline.[^25] Their analysis linked these mortality increases directly to labor market displacement. Communities where manufacturing employment fell by more than 30% experienced death rates 20-30% higher than similar communities with stable employment.

The mechanism involves cascading effects. Displaced workers reduce spending, harming local businesses. Property values decline, eroding household wealth and municipal tax bases. Schools deteriorate, reducing human capital formation for the next generation. Social institutions (churches, civic organizations) lose membership and resources. The community enters a negative spiral from which recovery is difficult.

Austin, Glaeser, and Summers (2018) analyzed 100 manufacturing-dependent cities over 40 years. They found that cities experiencing automation-driven employment decline of more than 20% saw population losses averaging 15%, median income decline of 12%, and increases in poverty rates of 8 percentage points.[^26]

These community-level effects create path dependence. Once a community enters the displacement trap, recovery requires coordinated intervention across multiple dimensions—job creation, infrastructure investment, education improvement, and social capital rebuilding. Market forces alone rarely generate such coordination.

The displacement trap thus operates at individual, occupational, regional, and community levels simultaneously. Workers cannot easily transition to new jobs. Regions cannot easily attract new industries. Communities cannot easily rebuild social capital. The result is persistent, concentrated economic distress that aggregate statistics obscure but that shapes the lived experience of millions of workers.
