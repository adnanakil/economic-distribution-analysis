# Strategic Content Plan: Automation and Wages

## Article Topic
**The Automation Wage Paradox: Why Robot Adoption Doesn't Always Mean Lower Pay**

## Recommended Angle

### PRIMARY ANGLE (RECOMMENDED):
**"The Heterogeneous Impact Thesis"** - Automation's effect on wages is not uniform but highly dependent on task composition, skill complementarity, and institutional context. This article will examine why automation raises wages for some workers while devastating others, using recent empirical evidence to challenge both techno-optimist and dystopian narratives.

**Why this angle works:**
- Cuts through simplistic "robots steal jobs" vs "automation creates prosperity" binary
- Grounded in recent empirical literature (Acemoglu & Restrepo, Autor et al.)
- Explains real-world puzzles: why wages rose in some automated industries but fell in others
- Actionable insights for workers, policymakers, and businesses
- Rich data visualization opportunities

### ALTERNATIVE ANGLES CONSIDERED:

**Option 2: "The Race Between Automation and Education"**
- Focus on skill-biased technological change
- PRO: Clear policy implications, well-established framework
- CON: Somewhat dated angle, doesn't explain recent wage stagnation among college graduates

**Option 3: "The Geography of Automation"**
- Regional analysis of automation winners and losers
- PRO: Highly relevant to political economy, spatial inequality
- CON: Narrower scope, might miss broader economic mechanisms

**Option 4: "Automation and Labor's Share of Income"**
- Macro-level analysis of capital vs labor
- PRO: Connects to inequality debates, important theoretical question
- CON: More abstract, harder to connect to individual worker experiences

**Option 5: "The AI Wage Shock"**
- Focus specifically on generative AI and white-collar wages
- PRO: Extremely timely, high reader interest
- CON: Limited empirical data, too speculative for data-driven approach

## Target Audience

- Policy professionals and researchers
- Labor economists and graduate students
- Think tank analysts and journalists
- Technology industry professionals concerned with labor impacts
- Union leaders and labor advocates

**Secondary:**
