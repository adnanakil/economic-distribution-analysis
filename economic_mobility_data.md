# Economic/Upward Mobility Changes Over Time in the US

## Summary of Key Findings

### 1. Bottom Quintile to Top Quintile Mobility
- **Current Rate**: Only 7.5% of children born to parents in the bottom income quintile reach the top quintile in adulthood in the US
- **Alternative estimates**: Some studies show as low as 4% success rate
- **Regional variation**: 
  - Low mobility areas (Southeast, Rust Belt): <5% chance
  - High mobility areas (Great Plains, West Coast): >15% chance
  - Charlotte, NC: 4.4%
  - San Jose, CA: ~13% (almost 3x Charlotte)

### 2. Historical Trends in Absolute Mobility (1940s-2020s)
- **1940 birth cohort**: 90-93% earned more than their parents
- **1980 birth cohort**: Only 45-50% earn more than their parents
- This represents a dramatic decline in the American Dream

### 3. Persistence in Economic Status
- 43% of children born in bottom quintile remain there as adults
- 40-42% of children born in top quintile remain there as adults
- For families in poverty, it takes approximately 5 generations to reach average income

### 4. International Comparisons
- US has lower mobility than most developed countries
- Denmark and Nordic countries have highest mobility rates
- Some US cities (Salt Lake City, San Jose) have mobility rates comparable to Denmark

### 5. Racial Disparities in Mobility
- **Black Americans**: 53% born in bottom quintile remain there
- **White Americans**: 33% born in bottom quintile remain there
- **Asian Americans**: Highest upward mobility rates
- **Hispanic Americans**: Slightly lower mobility than White Americans
- **Native Americans**: Lowest rates of upward mobility

### 6. Key Factors Affecting Mobility (Raj Chetty's Research)
- **Economic connectedness**: Most important predictor
  - Increasing share of high-SES friends among low-SES people from 25% to 50% associated with 8.2 percentile increase in adult income
- **Geographic factors**: Huge disparities across US regions
- **Educational institutions**: 
  - Mid-tier public universities (CUNY, Cal State) have highest bottom-to-top quintile mobility
  - Elite colleges have highest bottom-to-top 1% mobility

### 7. Relative vs Absolute Mobility
- **Relative mobility**: Has remained relatively flat for decades
- **Absolute mobility**: Sharp decline since 1940s

## Data Sources
1. **Opportunity Insights** (Raj Chetty and colleagues)
   - Administrative tax records
   - Population-wide data analysis
   
2. **Federal Reserve Research**
   - Chicago Fed studies on intergenerational mobility
   - Distributional Financial Accounts
   
3. **Pew Economic Mobility Project**
   - Longitudinal studies on income mobility
   
4. **Urban Institute**
   - Income distribution transitions

## Key Takeaways
The data shows a clear decline in economic mobility in the US over the past 80 years. While relative positions have remained fairly stable (moving between quintiles), absolute progress (earning more than parents) has plummeted from near-certainty to a coin flip. Geographic location, race, and social connections play crucial roles in determining mobility outcomes.
