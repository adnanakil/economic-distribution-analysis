# American Affordability Crisis: Research Summary

**Date:** October 2025
**Analysis Period:** 1980-2024 (where data available)

## Executive Summary

Americans are experiencing a **selective affordability crisis** where essential investments for upward mobility (housing, healthcare, education) have far outpaced wage growth, while basic consumption goods (food) have kept pace or become more affordable.

## Key Findings

### üè† Housing: SEVERE CRISIS
- **Home Price to Income Ratio:**
  - Current: 5.10x
  - Historical average: 2.94x
  - **73% higher than historical norms**
- **Quality-adjusted (homes 35% larger):** Still 28% less affordable
- Homeownership has become dramatically less accessible
- Median home price: $410,800 vs median household income: $83,730

### üè• Healthcare: MAJOR BURDEN
- **Medical costs vs wages (since 1980):**
  - Medical care CPI increased **4,323%**
  - Healthcare costs have grown **70% faster than wages**
- Burden Index: 1.70 (1980 = 1.00)
- Prescription drugs CPI at 1,146.9 (dramatic increase)

### üéì Education: SIGNIFICANT BURDEN
- **Education costs (1993-2024):**
  - Education CPI: +282%
  - Wage growth: +173%
  - **Gap: 109 percentage points**
- Education burden increased **40%** relative to wages
- Education costs consume 40% more of hourly wages in 2024 vs 1993

### üçî Food: RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE
- **Food costs (1980-2024):**
  - Food CPI: +280%
  - Wage growth: +340%
  - Food has become **14.5% more affordable** relative to wages
- Food burden index: 0.86 (1980 = 1.00)
- Only major category to improve vs wages

## The Bifurcated Economy

### Investment Goods (Crisis)
Items required for economic mobility and long-term security:
- Housing: 73% less affordable
- Healthcare: 70% more expensive than wages
- Education: 40% more burdensome

### Consumption Goods (Stable/Better)
Day-to-day necessities:
- Food: 14.5% more affordable
- Overall CPI: roughly in line with wages

## Quality Adjustments: Does This Account for Better Quality?

### Housing
- Homes are ~35% larger than in 1980 (1,595 sq ft ‚Üí 2,146 sq ft)
- **Size-adjusted affordability:** Still 28% worse than historical average
- **Verdict:** Crisis remains real even after quality adjustment

### Healthcare
- Modern healthcare is undeniably better (MRI, CT scans, biologics, advanced surgeries)
- **BUT:** No choice to opt-out of modern prices for basic care
- **AND:** Much of cost increase is administrative, not quality-driven
- **Verdict:** Affordability crisis remains even if outcomes improved

### Education
- Quality evidence is mixed: more facilities/tech, but grade inflation and administrative bloat
- Labor market returns to degree have increased (quality or credentialism?)
- **Verdict:** Likely a real affordability crisis, quality improvements questionable

## Implications

1. **Generational Divide**: Younger Americans face dramatically higher barriers to homeownership and education vs their parents

2. **Trapped in Place**: Can afford to eat, but cannot afford to invest in economic mobility (education, housing, healthcare)

3. **Real vs Perceived Affordability**:
   - Headlines show "real wages" keeping pace with "inflation"
   - But "inflation" basket is dominated by goods that got cheaper
   - Investment goods crucial for mobility are in crisis

4. **Policy Mismatch**:
   - CPI-based policy (focused on consumption) misses crisis in investment goods
   - Tax policy, housing policy, and healthcare policy have failed to address structural issues

5. **The "No Choice" Problem**:
   - Can't buy 1980s healthcare at 1980s prices
   - Can't buy 1980s housing (smaller) at 1980s prices (zoning, regulations)
   - Education credentialism means can't opt-out of expensive degrees

## Data Sources
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- Housing: Case-Shiller Index, Median Home Prices, Median Household Income
- Healthcare: CPI Medical Care, Hospital Services, Prescription Drugs
- Education: CPI Education, Education Services
- Food: CPI Food, Food at Home
- Wages: Average Hourly Earnings (Private Sector)

## Next Steps
This data supports a blog post narrative about how Americans can "afford to survive but not afford to thrive" - trapped in a system where basic consumption is manageable but investment in future economic security is increasingly out of reach.
