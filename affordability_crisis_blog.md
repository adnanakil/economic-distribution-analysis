# The American Affordability Paradox: Why You Can Afford to Survive But Not to Thrive

Americans are living through a deeply confusing economic moment. Unemployment is low. Wages are rising. Inflation, we're told, is under control. And yet, millions of people feel like they're drowning financially. Homeownership feels impossible. Healthcare costs are crushing. College is unaffordable without massive debt. So what's going on?

The answer lies in a fundamental bifurcation of the American economy that aggregate statistics completely miss. When you break down what Americans actually spend money on, a stark pattern emerges: **the things you need to survive are holding steady or getting cheaper, while the things you need to thrive‚Äîto build wealth, to invest in your future, to achieve economic mobility‚Äîhave become prohibitively expensive.**

Let me show you what I mean with data.

## The Four Pillars of American Life

I analyzed four major categories of household spending from 1980 to 2024, comparing their cost growth to wage growth. Here's what I found:

### üçî Food: The Good News

Since 1980, food prices have increased 280%. That sounds terrible until you realize that average hourly wages increased 340% over the same period. **Food has actually become 14.5% more affordable relative to wages.**

This is the only major spending category where Americans are genuinely better off than their parents' generation. You can, quite literally, afford to eat better than your grandparents could in 1980.

### üè† Housing: The Crisis

Now let's look at housing, and this is where things get dark.

The median home price to median household income ratio currently sits at **5.10x**. The historical average is 2.94x. Homes are **73% less affordable** than they were historically.

"But wait," you might object, "homes are bigger now! The median new home is 2,146 square feet compared to 1,595 in 1980‚Äîthat's 35% larger!"

Fair point. Let's adjust for that. Even after accounting for 35% larger homes, housing is still **28% less affordable** than the historical average. And here's the kicker: you can't actually choose to buy a 1980s-sized home at 1980s prices. Zoning laws, building codes, and market dynamics mean that smaller, cheaper homes simply aren't being built in most markets.

The median home price is now $410,800. The median household income is $83,730. Do that math. A generation ago, a middle-class salary could buy you a home. Today, it buys you a fantasy.

### üè• Healthcare: The Slow Squeeze

Healthcare costs have increased **4,323%** since 1947. Let that sink in. Even focusing on the 1980-2024 period, healthcare costs have grown **70% faster than wages**.

To put this in concrete terms: healthcare costs consume 70% more of your hourly wages today than they did in 1980.

Now, defenders of the system will point out‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîthat healthcare is objectively better today. We have MRIs, advanced cancer treatments, biologics, minimally invasive surgeries. Your grandparents' doctor couldn't do half of what modern medicine can do.

But here's the problem: **you don't get to choose**. You can't walk into a hospital and say "give me 1980s healthcare at 1980s prices." When you need care, you pay modern prices whether you want cutting-edge treatment or basic care. And a huge portion of healthcare cost increases aren't from better care‚Äîthey're from administrative bloat, billing complexity, and profit extraction.

The "quality is better" argument is true but irrelevant when you can't opt out of the system.

### üéì Education: The Credentialism Trap

Since 1993 (when reliable data begins), education costs have increased **282%** while wages have increased only **173%**. That's a gap of **109 percentage points**.

Education costs consume **40% more of your hourly wages** today compared to 1993.

The quality defense is even weaker here. Yes, campuses have nicer facilities, better technology, more student services. But they also have massive administrative bloat, grade inflation, and questionable learning outcomes. The labor market returns to a college degree have increased‚Äîbut is that because education got better, or because credentialism became more entrenched?

Regardless, the outcome is the same: you can't participate in the modern economy without expensive credentials. Opting out means opting out of the middle class.

## The Bifurcated Economy

Let me put this all together. What we're seeing is an economy that has split into two distinct categories:

**Consumption Goods** (Food, commodities, basic necessities)
- Stable or decreasing relative to wages
- You can afford to survive
- Day-to-day life is manageable

**Investment Goods** (Housing, healthcare, education)
- Skyrocketing relative to wages
- You cannot afford to thrive
- Building wealth and mobility is blocked

This explains the paradox. When economists and policymakers look at "inflation" and "real wages," they're averaging across all goods. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) treats a loaf of bread the same as a college credit. By that measure, things look okay‚Äîwages are keeping pace with inflation!

But that average obscures the crisis. Yes, you can afford groceries. But you can't afford a house, you're terrified of getting sick, and you can't send your kids to college without crushing debt.

**You can afford to survive, but you cannot afford to thrive.**

## The Generational Divide

This bifurcation creates a brutal generational divide.

In 1980, if you had a middle-class income, you could:
- Buy a house for 3x your annual salary
- Send your kids to college for a reasonable fraction of your income
- Afford healthcare without financial ruin
- Still have money left over for savings and retirement

In 2024, with that same relative middle-class income, you:
- Face housing that costs 5x your annual salary (or 3.8x for a 35% larger house)
- Watch college consume 40% more of your wages
- Live in fear of medical bankruptcy
- Delay homeownership, delay having children, delay everything

Food is cheaper, but you're still broke. Because food isn't what determines whether you build wealth or stay trapped.

## The "No Choice" Problem

The cruelest aspect of this bifurcation is what I call the "No Choice" problem.

In theory, if something gets more expensive, you can choose not to buy it, substitute something cheaper, or buy less of it. This is how markets are supposed to work.

But for housing, healthcare, and education, **there is no opt-out**:

- You can't buy 1980s-sized homes at 1980s prices due to zoning laws and building regulations
- You can't buy 1980s-level healthcare at 1980s prices when you need medical care
- You can't opt out of college credentials without opting out of the middle class

These aren't normal market goods. They're essential investments in your economic future, and the market has been systematically rigged against you.

## Why This Matters

This bifurcated economy explains so much of our current political and social dysfunction:

**Why people feel poor despite "good" economic numbers:** Because the numbers measure the wrong things. CPI says inflation is fine. But CPI doesn't capture the despair of realizing you'll never own a home.

**Why young people are delaying life milestones:** You can't start a family when you're crushed by student debt and can't afford a house.

**Why social mobility has collapsed:** When the ladder to success costs 5x what it used to, fewer people can climb it.

**Why there's so much rage at "the system":** Because the system is delivering cheap food and expensive futures. You can eat well while watching your dreams die.

## The Policy Implications

If we're serious about fixing this, we need to stop treating all inflation equally. The problem isn't that the CPI is too high. The problem is that investment goods‚Äîthe things that determine whether you can build wealth and achieve mobility‚Äîhave become luxuries reserved for the already-wealthy.

We need policies that specifically target housing, healthcare, and education costs:

- **Housing:** Zoning reform, land value taxes, public housing investment
- **Healthcare:** Single-payer systems, price controls, administrative simplification
- **Education:** Free public college, elimination of student debt, reduction in credentialism

Lowering the price of eggs won't fix this. We have cheap eggs. What we need are affordable futures.

## Conclusion

The American Dream used to be simple: work hard, play by the rules, and you can buy a home, raise a family, send your kids to college, and retire with dignity.

That dream is now mathematically impossible for most Americans, not because they're not working hard enough, but because the math has changed. The things you need to survive are fine. The things you need to thrive are out of reach.

Until we acknowledge this bifurcation‚Äîuntil we stop averaging away the crisis with aggregate statistics‚Äîwe'll continue to scratch our heads wondering why Americans feel so economically anxious despite "good" numbers.

The numbers are good if you want to eat. The numbers are catastrophic if you want to live.
