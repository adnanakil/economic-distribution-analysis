                    Do bad economic conditions and low growth lead democracies to adopt populist attitudes and tend toward fascism? This analysis examines historical case studies from Weimar Germany to modern Greece, alongside recent academic research.
                </div>
                <div class="post-description" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    The evidence reveals consistent patterns across nearly a century of data:
                </div>
                <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 3px solid #667eea;">
                    <strong>Weimar Germany (1928-1933):</strong> As unemployment rose from 8.5% to 30%, Nazi vote share increased from 2.6% to 37.3% (correlation: 0.948)
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Greece (2009-2015):</strong> As unemployment reached 25%, Golden Dawn increased from 0.29% to 7% of the vote (correlation: 0.992)
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Hungary (2006-2014):</strong> Debt crisis and unemployment drove Jobbik from 2.6% to 20.2% of the vote
                    <br><br>
                    Academic research confirms: a 1-point increase in unemployment correlates with a 1-point increase in populist voting. Economic uncertainty produces a 2.8 percentage point increase in populist support. Between 1920 and 1939, the number of democracies in Europe fell from 24 to 11â€”a 54% decline during severe economic crisis.

                <div class="post-description">
                    Americans are living through a confusing economic moment: low unemployment, rising wages, controlled inflationâ€”yet millions feel financially crushed. The answer lies in a fundamental bifurcation of the economy that aggregate statistics completely miss.
                </div>
                <div class="post-description" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Analysis of four major spending categories (housing, healthcare, education, food) from 1980-2024 reveals a stark pattern:
                </div>
                <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 3px solid #667eea;">
                    <strong>Investment goods</strong> (housing, healthcare, education) have become prohibitively expensiveâ€”73% less affordable for housing, 70% more expensive healthcare, 40% more burdensome educationâ€”while <strong>consumption goods</strong> (food) have become 15% MORE affordable.
                    <br><br>
                    You can afford to <em>survive</em>, but you cannot afford to <em>thrive</em>. Food is cheap. Building wealth is impossible. The things you need to eat are fine; the things you need to achieve economic mobilityâ€”buying a home, getting healthcare, earning a degreeâ€”are out of reach.
                    <br><br>
                    Even quality-adjusted (homes are 35% larger), housing is still 28% less affordable than historical norms. And you can't opt-out: zoning laws prevent smaller homes, you can't buy "1980s healthcare" at 1980s prices, and credentialism means you can't skip expensive degrees.

                    Eight charts that reveal how economic rewards have shifted from workers to capital owners, machines, and foreign competitors. Notable because often when people complain about declining labor share it turns out to be unfounded - Anthropic in the past have emphasized that they don't change the model weights after releasing them without changing the version number.

                <div class="post-description" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    In this case a comprehensive analysis of BLS data from 1947 to present reveals a genuine shift in economic rewards away from labor toward capital, with labor's share of income declining from 65% to 56.5% over 75 years:
                </div>
                <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 3px solid #667eea;">
                    From 1947 to 2024, we've witnessed a dramatic reallocation of economic rewards. Labor compensation has fallen from 65% to 56.5% of national income. This represents approximately $1.8 trillion annually that has shifted from workers to capital owners, landlords, and corporate profits.
                    <br><br>
                    This was caused by a combination of technological displacement, globalization (particularly the China Shock), weakening labor institutions, and tax policies that increasingly favor capital over labor [...]
                    <br><br>
                    We've also discovered that current tax incentives actively encourage businesses to replace workers with machines, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of automation.
