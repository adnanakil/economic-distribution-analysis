<h1>The American Affordability Crisis</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Analyzing differential cost trends across housing, healthcare, education, and food from 1980 to 2024</p>
<p style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 0.5rem; text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem;">Last updated: October 7, 2025 @ 22:00 UTC</p>

<div class="intro-box">
  <h2>Understanding the Affordability Gap</h2>
  <p>Standard economic indicators show unemployment is low, wages are rising, and inflation has moderated. Yet surveys consistently show Americans report significant financial stress around housing costs, healthcare expenses, and education debt.</p>
  <p>This analysis examines spending patterns across four major categories from 1980-2024. The data reveals a bifurcation in the American economy: consumption goods have remained affordable relative to wages, while investment goods—those that enable wealth building and economic mobility—have become significantly less affordable.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: 600;">The following four charts show these trends.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 1: Housing Crisis -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>1. Housing: Price-to-Income Ratios Have Risen Substantially</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Home prices have increased 73% more than incomes relative to historical norms—even after adjusting for 35% larger homes, still 28% less affordable</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="housingChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div class="narrative-section crisis-box">
  <h3>Price-to-Income Analysis</h3>
  <p>The median home price to median household income ratio currently sits at <span class="stat-highlight">5.10x</span>. The historical average is 2.94x. This represents a <span class="stat-highlight">73% increase</span> in the ratio compared to historical norms.</p>
  <p>A quality adjustment is warranted: the median new home is 2,146 square feet compared to 1,595 in 1980—35% larger. Adjusting for this size difference, housing affordability has declined by <span class="stat-highlight">28%</span> relative to the historical average.</p>
  <p>However, buyers cannot readily substitute smaller homes at proportionally lower prices. Zoning regulations, building codes, and market conditions limit the availability of smaller new construction in most markets.</p>
  <p>Current figures: median home price is $410,800 and median household income is $83,730, yielding the 5.10x ratio noted above.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 2: Healthcare Costs -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>2. Healthcare: Costs Have Grown 70% Faster Than Wages</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Medical costs have increased substantially more than wage growth since 1980</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="healthcareChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div class="narrative-section crisis-box">
  <h3>Cost Growth Analysis</h3>
  <p>Healthcare costs have increased <span class="stat-highlight">4,323%</span> since 1947. Focusing on the 1980-2024 period, healthcare costs have grown <span class="stat-highlight">70% faster than wages</span>.</p>
  <p>In relative terms: healthcare costs consume 70% more of hourly wages today than they did in 1980.</p>
  <p>Quality improvements must be considered in this analysis. Modern healthcare includes technologies unavailable in 1980: MRI and CT imaging, advanced cancer treatments, biologics, and minimally invasive surgical techniques that improve patient outcomes.</p>
  <p>However, patients face current market prices regardless of which treatments they require. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2674671" target="_blank" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">2018 JAMA study</a> comparing the US to 10 high-income countries found the US spends 8% of healthcare costs on administrative complexity—compared to 1-3% in other nations. This amounts to approximately $1,000 per person in the US versus $170 elsewhere. Administrative costs are a significant driver of why US healthcare spending is approximately twice that of comparable countries.</p>
  <p>The quality improvement argument, while valid, does not fully explain cost differentials when compared to other developed nations with similar health outcomes and technology access.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 3: Education Credentialism -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>3. Education: Costs Have Grown 109 Percentage Points Faster Than Wages</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Education costs have grown 109 percentage points faster than wages since 1993</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="educationChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div class="narrative-section crisis-box">
  <h3>Cost Trend Analysis</h3>
  <p>Since 1993 (when reliable data begins), education costs have increased <span class="stat-highlight">282%</span> while wages have increased <span class="stat-highlight">173%</span>. That's a gap of 109 percentage points.</p>
  <p>In relative terms: education costs consume 40% more of hourly wages today compared to 1993.</p>
  <p>Quality adjustments in education are more difficult to quantify than in housing or healthcare. Modern campuses include upgraded facilities, technology infrastructure, and expanded student services unavailable in 1993. However, measuring educational quality improvements through learning outcomes or labor market preparation remains an active area of research without clear consensus.</p>
  <p>Labor market returns to a college degree have increased over this period, though economists debate whether this reflects improved educational quality or increased credentialing requirements for positions that previously did not require degrees. The practical effect is that higher education has become increasingly necessary for access to middle-class occupations, making the cost trends economically significant regardless of their underlying causes.</p>
</div>

<!-- Chart 4: Food - The Good News -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>4. Food: Relative Affordability Has Improved</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Food has become 15% more affordable relative to wages since 1980</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="foodChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div class="narrative-section good-box">
  <h3>Cost Trend Analysis</h3>
  <p>Since 1980, food prices have increased 280% while average hourly wages increased 340% over the same period. <span class="stat-good">Food has become 14.5% more affordable relative to wages.</span></p>
  <p>This represents the only major spending category examined in this analysis where relative affordability has improved compared to the 1980 baseline.</p>
  <p>However, food represents a smaller share of household budgets compared to housing, healthcare, and education costs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that food accounts for approximately 12-13% of household expenditures, while housing accounts for 33%, and healthcare for 8%. The differential affordability trends across these categories therefore have asymmetric impacts on overall household financial well-being.</p>
</div>

<!-- Comparison Chart -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>5. The Bifurcated Economy: Investment vs Consumption</h2>
  <p class="chart-description">Investment goods (housing, healthcare, education) have diverged sharply from consumption goods (food)</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper"><div id="comparisonChart"></div></div>
</div>

<div class="narrative-section warning-box">
  <h3>Differential Cost Trends Across Categories</h3>
  <p>The data reveals distinct patterns across spending categories:</p>
  <p><strong>Consumption Goods</strong> (Food, commodities, basic necessities)</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Stable or decreasing relative to wages</li>
    <li>Improved affordability compared to 1980 baseline</li>
    <li>Lower budget share and immediate consumption cycle</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Investment Goods</strong> (Housing, healthcare, education)</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    <li>Substantial cost increases relative to wages</li>
    <li>Reduced affordability compared to 1980 baseline</li>
    <li>Higher budget share and long-term financial implications</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This bifurcation helps explain divergent economic perceptions. Aggregate measures like the Consumer Price Index weight all goods and services proportionally. When wage growth matches or exceeds CPI, economists typically conclude real wages are stable or improving.</p>
  <p>However, this aggregate measure does not distinguish between the affordability of different spending categories. The data show that households can more easily afford consumption goods like food, while simultaneously facing reduced affordability for investment goods like housing, healthcare, and education.</p>
  <p>Since investment goods typically require larger budget allocations and have longer-term financial consequences (mortgages, medical debt, student loans), the differential affordability trends may contribute to financial stress despite positive aggregate indicators.</p>
</div>

<div class="insights">
  <h3>Generational Comparison</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1980 baseline:</strong> Median home price-to-income ratio of 2.94x, education costs indexed at baseline, healthcare costs indexed at baseline</li>
    <li><strong>2024 figures:</strong> Median home price-to-income ratio of 5.10x (or 3.78x when quality-adjusted for 35% larger homes), education costs consuming 40% more wage hours relative to 1993 baseline, healthcare costs 70% higher relative to wages</li>
    <li><strong>Asymmetric trends:</strong> Consumption goods like food have become 14.5% more affordable, while investment goods have become substantially less affordable</li>
    <li><strong>Market constraints:</strong> Consumers face limited ability to substitute lower-cost alternatives in housing (zoning restrictions limit smaller home construction), healthcare (required coverage and no opt-out for medical needs), and education (credential requirements for professional occupations)</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate vs. disaggregate measures:</strong> Broad inflation indices like CPI weight all goods proportionally, which may not capture the financial impact of differential affordability trends across major spending categories with different budget shares and long-term implications</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="background: #fee2e2; border-left: 4px solid #dc2626; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 0 0.5rem 0.5rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #991b1b;">Policy Considerations</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">The differential affordability trends across spending categories suggest that aggregate inflation measures may not fully capture the policy-relevant economic pressures facing households. Investment goods—housing, healthcare, and education—represent larger budget shares and have long-term financial implications through debt accumulation.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Policy interventions targeting specific categories have been proposed by various economists and policymakers:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Zoning reform to increase density, land value taxation, public housing investment, and construction subsidies</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Single-payer systems, price regulation, administrative simplification, and public option programs</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Expanded public funding for higher education, student debt relief programs, and reduced occupational licensing requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">These policy options remain subject to debate regarding their effectiveness, implementation costs, and trade-offs. The data presented here document the cost trends but do not prescribe specific policy solutions.</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #1e293b; color: #f1f5f9; padding: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0 0 0; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
  <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Summary of Findings</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">This analysis examined affordability trends across four major spending categories from 1980 to 2024, comparing cost increases to wage growth.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Key findings:</strong> Food costs have become 14.5% more affordable relative to wages. Housing, healthcare, and education costs have all increased substantially faster than wages—by 73 percentage points (housing), 70 percentage points (healthcare), and 109 percentage points (education) respectively.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin: 0;">These differential trends across spending categories may help explain why households report financial stress despite positive aggregate economic indicators like low unemployment and stable CPI-adjusted wages.</p>
